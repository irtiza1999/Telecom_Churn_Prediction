# **Strategic Analytics for Telecom Churn Prediction using Machine Learning Approaches**
<br />

## Abstract
In the telecommunications market where customer retention is extremely important, churn prediction becomes the key factor to maintain or gain the industry stability and manage the continuing growth. This research is dedicated to the proposing of complex machine-learning algorithms which would enable the prediction of customer’s churning propensity, relying on the collection of a wide range of customer’s behavioural data over a three-month period. All-important data in the data set comprises of call frequencies (inbound and outgoing), data consumed through 3G and 2G networks, recharge amount, duration of service with the network, the monthly average revenue per user and so on. We endeavour to use machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to address the prediction challenge well. The performance of each model is assessed thoroughly in order to identify which approach is a better option for the problem of potential churners. The aim of this research not only relates to the accurate predictions of groups of algorithms but also to improving decision-making for customer retention programs.
